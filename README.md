# pong-clone

Pong is a classic game released by Atari in 1972. A ball or "puck" bounces across the screen between two paddles controlled by opposing players. The goal of the game is to bounce the ball past the opposing player into their score field for a point. First player to 11 points wins. 

Getting Started



I have included an executable build in the Builds folder. Feel free to run this on a VM for security reasons. To run the game, simply open the executable in the Builds folder [pong-clone -> Builds -> pong-clone.exe]. Alternatively you can clone the repository and import it as a Unity project, but this requires an installation of the Unity game engine.
